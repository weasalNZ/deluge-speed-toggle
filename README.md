### Configuration Wizard

When you add the integration, you'll be prompted to enter:

#### Connection Settings
- **Host**: IP address or hostname of your Deluge server (default: `localhost`)
- **Port**: Deluge web UI port (default: `8112`)
- **Password**: Deluge web UI password (required)

#### Speed Presets
- **Preset 1 Name**: Label for the first preset (default: "Limited")
  - **Download Speed**: Download limit in KiB/s (default: `500`)

### Speed Units

All speeds are specified in **KiB/s** (kilobytes per second):
- Use `-1` to set unlimited speed for either direction
- Common values:
  - `100` = 100 KiB/s (≈ 0.8 Mbps)
  - `500` = 500 KiB/s (≈ 4 Mbps)
  - `1000` = 1000 KiB/s (≈ 8 Mbps)

  ## Usage

### Using the Switch in Home Assistant UI
- Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities** in Home Assistant.
- Find the **Deluge Speed Toggle** switch.
- Click the toggle to switch between your configured speed presets:
  - **OFF** = Preset 1 (Limited speeds)
  - **ON** = Preset 2 (Unlimited speeds)

### Using in Automations
You can automate speed changes with Home Assistant automations:
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Limit Deluge at night"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "22:00:00"
    action:
      service: switch.turn_off
      entity_id: switch.deluge_speed_toggle

  - alias: "Unlimited Deluge in morning"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "08:00:00"
    action:
      service: switch.turn_on
      entity_id: switch.deluge_speed_toggle
```

### Using the Service Call
You can also make direct service calls for fine-grained control:
- **Service**: `deluge_speed.set_speed`
- **Parameters**:
  - `download`: Download speed in KiB/s (`-1` for unlimited)
  - `upload`: Upload speed in KiB/s (`-1` for unlimited)
- **Example**:
```yaml
service: deluge_speed.set_speed
data:
  download: 2000
  upload: 500
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
**Error:** "Cannot connect to Deluge" appears during setup
- Verify Deluge is running and accessible on the network
- Check the host and port settings
- Ensure the port is not blocked by a firewall
- Test with: `curl -X POST http://DELUGE_HOST:8112/json`
- Confirm the correct web UI password is used
- Make sure Deluge's JSON-RPC API is enabled

### Authentication Failed
**Error:** "Deluge authentication failed: Invalid password"
- Double-check your Deluge web UI password
- Avoid special characters that may cause issues
- Restart Deluge and try again

### Switch Not Responding
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors (Settings → System → Logs)
- Ensure Deluge is running and reachable
- Verify network connectivity between Home Assistant and Deluge
- Restart Home Assistant

### Card Not Displaying or Entity ID Issues
- Ensure the expected entity IDs exist (e.g., `switch.deluge_speed_toggle`)
- If entity IDs have numbers at the end (e.g., `sensor.deluge_download_speed_2`), recreate entity IDs in Home Assistant:
  1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**
  2. Find **Deluge Speed Toggle** and click the arrow next to your Deluge Server
  3. Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right corner
  4. Select **Recreate Entity IDs**
  5. Restart Home Assistant if prompted

#### Example: Entity ID Error
If your Deluge Status Card does not display correctly and you notice that entity IDs have numbers at the end (e.g., `sensor.deluge_download_speed_2`), it may look similar to the screenshot below:

![Deluge Status Card Entity ID Error](www/hacsfiles/deluge-status-card/deluge-status-card-entity-id-error.png)

This usually means the card cannot find the expected entities. See the steps above to recreate entity IDs and resolve this issue.

### Logging
Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml` for more details:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.deluge_speed: debug
```
Then check logs in Home Assistant UI: **Settings → System → Logs**

## Testing the Deluge JSON-RPC API

If you encounter connection or authentication issues, you can manually test the Deluge JSON-RPC API using curl:

**Test Connection:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://<DELUGE_HOST>:8112/json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "auth.login",
    "params": ["your-password"],
    "id": 1
  }'
```

**Set Speeds Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://<DELUGE_HOST>:8112/json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "core.set_config",
    "params": [{
      "max_download_speed": 500,
      "max_upload_speed": 100
    }],
    "id": 2
  }'
```

Replace `<DELUGE_HOST>` and `your-password` with your actual Deluge server address and password.
